		<h2>Accounts Vary On How Attack Began in Niger </h2>
		<h3>African Soldiers Tell of Unapproved Mission</h3>
		<p class="first-letter">This article is by Dionne Searcey,
		Helene Cooper and Eric Schmitt</p>
		<p>The Pentagon is trying to determine
		whether American forces involved
		in a deadly ambush in Niger
		this month diverted from their
		routine patrol to embark on an unapproved
		mission, military officials
		said on Friday.</p>
		<p>The questions have come up because
		the American and Nigerien
		soldiers on the patrol have given
		conflicting accounts about
		whether they were simply ambushed
		or were attacked after trying
		to chase Islamic insurgents,
		according to military officials
		from both countries.</p>
		<p>The episode has engulfed the
		White House in crisis and
		prompted demands from members
		of Congress for answers
		about what the soldiers were doing
		before the attack on Oct. 4.</p>
		<p>In interviews with both the Defense
		Department and The New
		York Times, Nigerien military officials
		said that a lightly armed
		convoy of about 50 Nigerien and
		American soldiers gave chase to
		Islamic insurgents on motorcycles
		until the men crossed the
		border into Mali, then returned
		later to ambush the troops.</p>
		<p>American service members, by
		contrast, insisted that they did not
		chase the insurgents but simply
		“noticed” them in the vicinity of
		the village of Tongo Tongo, Defense
		Department officials said. It
		was not until the troops interviewed
		village leaders and were
		on their way to their base, by the
		American account, that the insurgents
		ambushed the convoy, overwhelming
		them.</p>
		<p>The inconsistencies are at the
		heart of why the Pentagon has not
		been forthcoming with details
		about what happened in Niger, according
		to American military officials,
		who spoke on the condition
		of anonymity to discuss a continuing
		investigation. Four Americans
		were killed in the attack, including
		three Green Berets, as well as four
		Nigerien soldiers. Two Americans
		and six Nigeriens were wounded.</p>
		<p>The contradictions added to the
		major questions emerging about
		the attack: Had the soldiers acted
		beyond their planned mission
		without first gaining approval?
		And if they were given permission,
		who granted it?</p>

		<h2>VIDEO DISPROVES STORY KELLY TOLD ABOUT LAWMAKER</h2>
		<h3>FEUD GROWS OVER CALL</h3>
		<h3>Congresswoman Sees Racial Bias in White House Response</h3>
		<span class="bold">By YAMICHE ALCINDOR and MICHAEL D. SHEAR</span>
		<p>WASHINGTON — Video of a
		2015 speech delivered by Representative
		Frederica S. Wilson revealed
		Friday that John F. Kelly,
		the White House chief of staff, misrepresented
		her remarks when he
		accused her of bragging about securing
		$20 million for a South
		Florida F.B.I. building and twisting
		President Barack Obama’s
		arm.</p>
		<p>Mr. Kelly, escalating a feud between
		Mr. Trump and Ms. Wilson,
		had cast the congresswoman on
		Thursday as a publicity-seeking
		opportunist. However, the video,
		released by The Sun Sentinel, a
		newspaper in South Florida,
		showed that during her nineminute
		speech, Ms. Wilson never
		took credit for getting the money
		for the building, only for helping
		pass legislation naming the building
		after two fallen federal agents.</p>
		<p>She never mentioned pleading
		with Mr. Obama, and she acknowledged
		the help of several Republicans,
		including John A. Boehner,
		then the House speaker; Representatives
		Mario Diaz-Balart and
		Carlos Curbelo; and Senator
		Marco Rubio.</p>
		<p>Ms. Wilson, in an interview on
		Friday, called Mr. Kelly a liar and
		hinted strongly that the altercation,
		prompted by a call from President
		Trump to the widow of a fallen
		black soldier, was racially
		charged.</p>
		<blockquote class="quote">“The White House itself is full of
		white supremacists,” she said.
		“I feel very sorry for him because
		he feels such a need to lie on
		me and I’m not even his enemy,”
		Ms. Wilson said of Mr. Kelly. “I just
		can’t even imagine why he would
		fabricate something like that.
		That is absolutely insane. I’m just
		flabbergasted because it’s very
		easy to trace.”</blockquote>
		<p>While she stopped short of accusing
		Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine
		general, of racial animus, she did
		say that others in the White House
		are racially biased.</p>

		<h2>Pressure Builds On Wells Fargo In Fraud Case</h2>
		<p><span class="bold">By GRETCHEN MORGENSON</span></p>
		<p>A federal regulator criticized

		<p>The confidential report, prepared

		<h2 class="class">Global City Is the Center of a Secessionist Feud</h2>
		<h3>Catalan Independence Is Complex Question for Barcelona</h3>
		<p><span class="bold">By PATRICK KINGSLEY</span></p>
		<p>BARCELONA, Spain — These
		days, the city of Barcelona wears
		two hats. And not too comfortably.
		On the one hand, Barcelona is a
		global city, a former host of the
		Olympics, and the home of one of
		the world’s most famous soccer
		clubs, F.C. Barcelona. It is a magnet
		for more than 10 million visitors
		a year, an example of the
		ways large cities increasingly influence
		global politics, economics
		and culture.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, Barcelona is
		the capital of Catalonia, Spain’s
		restive northeastern region, and
		the nerve center of a drive for Catalan
		independence that is described
		by its opponents as parochial,
		exclusive and nationalist.</p>
		<p>In that campaign — which the
		Spanish government now says it
		will take emergency measures to
		halt — there is no place in Catalonia
		with more at stake. In Barcelona,
		the issue of independence
		has provoked exceptionally sharp
		soul-searching and debate over allegiances
		and identity, with an intensity
		not seen since Britain
		voted to leave the European Union.</p>
		<p>In short, people are worried.
		First among them is the city’s leftist
		mayor, Ada Colau, who, despite
		expressing support for independence
		in the past, says she is now
		not in favor of leaving. “It’s a very
		pluralistic city and there is a lot of
		diversity of opinions in Barcelona,”
		she said in an interview
		this week.</p>
		<p>The city is not exactly comparable
		to London — which favored remaining
		in the European Union —
		since Barcelona is still home to
		many separatists.</p>
		<blockquote class="quote">“But if you compare
		it with people in the heart of
		Catalonia,” Ms. Colau said, “it’s
		not as pro-independence.”</blockquote>
		<p>Ms. Colau said she was appalled
		by the violence of the Spanish national
		police as they tried to block
		people from voting in the Oct. 1 independence
		referendum, and she
		believes in Catalonia’s right to
		self-determination.</p>
		<p>But her own attitude to independence
		differs from that of the
		Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont,
		a lifelong separatist from</p>
		<p>Girona, a small city 60 miles
		northeast of Barcelona.
		As an economic powerhouse
		that has welcomed migrants from
		many other parts of Spain, Barcelona
		has a more “cosmopolitan”
		outlook than the rest of Catalonia,
		Ms. Colau said.</p>
		<p>Cities, rather than nation states,
		“are the future,” she said. “I am a
		citizen of Barcelona and a municipalist
		— and that’s the main reason
		that I am in the city hall not
		the Catalan regional government.”
		The region’s Oct. 1 referendum
		was a deeply compromised barometer
		of popular sentiment.</p>
		<p>Though official figures show that
		90 percent of voters supported independence,
		only about 43 percent
		of the Catalan electorate took
		part in a vote that was banned by
		the Spanish courts and which the
		national government tried to stop
		by force.</p>
		<p>Many of those opposed to separation
		had little incentive to brave
		the police violence. Yet a breakdown
		of the results shows that the</p>

		<h2>Body Cameras Watch Officers With Little Effect, Study Finds</h2>
		<p><span class="bold">By AMANDA RIPLEY and TIMOTHY WILLIAMS</span></p>
		<p>After a series of high-profile police
		shootings, police departments
		across the nation turned to body
		cameras, hoping they would curb
		abuses. But a rigorous study released
		Friday shows that they
		have almost no effect on officer
		behavior.</p>
		<p>The 18-month study of more
		than 2,000 police officers in Washington
		found that officers
		equipped with cameras used force
		and prompted civilian complaints
		at about the same rate as those
		who did not have them.</p>
		<p>Advocates for body cameras —
		including police officers, lawmakers
		and citizens in high-crime
		neighborhoods — have long argued
		that requiring officers to
		wear the devices would have a
		“civilizing effect” on both officers</p>
		<figure><img class="img" src="https://goo.gl/AET67w" alt="img1">

		<h3>Police departments have been quick to adopt body cameras.</h3>
		<p>and the civilians who encounter
		them. After the 2014 fatal police
		shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed
		African-American man, in
		Ferguson, Mo., calls for their use
		became more widespread.</p>

		<figcaption class="small-text">DEMETRIUS FREEMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES</figcaption></figure>
		<p>In a lace-accented white wedding
		gown, Chirlane McCray, the
		first lady of New York City, made
		her way up the church aisle and
		turned to face the crowd. Arrayed
		before her were not the familiar
		faces of friends and family, but
		dozens of other women in similar
		bridal attire as they prepared to
		march across Upper Manhattan in
		solidarity against domestic violence.
		“There’s nothing like putting on
		the garb,” she said after the event
		last month.</p>
		<p>After nearly one full term, Ms.
		McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de
		Blasio, has fully wrapped herself
		in the role of political spouse, a job
		especially steeped with symbolism
		for her. As the African-American
		wife of a white mayor in a moment
		of renewed racial strife
		across America, Ms. McCray has
		emerged as likely the most influential,
		if not consequential, first
		lady in the city’s history.</p>
		<p>She has a full-time staff of five
		and her own public schedule. She
		oversees a portfolio of municipal
		programs, including her signature
		$850 million mental health
		initiative, in which other city officials
		report to her. She controls an
		independent nonprofit with a $25
		million annual budget and still
		more staff. And she has the mayor’s
		ear on decisions big and
		small, sitting in on top-level job interviews,
		policy formulation and
		senior staff meetings.</p>
		<p>“Where’s Chirlane?” is a regular
		refrain heard around City Hall
		as Mr. de Blasio wonders aloud
		why she is not in a particular
		meeting, or where she stands on
		an issue. </p>
		<p>In a wide-ranging interview
		this month at Gracie Mansion, Ms.
		McCray outlined her ambitious
		agenda, which is topped by reimagining
